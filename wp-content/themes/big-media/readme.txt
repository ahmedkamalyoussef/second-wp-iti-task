A theme called Big Breeze.

== Description ==

This theme features maximizing the use of images as a way to give a site a unique look.  
It does this by creating a layout that adapts well to a variety of different header videos and header images as well as background images.  
It also gives users the option to decide how to allow mobile browsers to utilize images and videos.  
Users may find that they can create a unique look by just uploading a video and a few images. 
Finally, it includes a sticky navbar and slidepanel menu for mobile browsers.

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload Theme and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.

* This theme is authored by Bob Wilson.  It is based on my Big Breeze theme.  The purpose of this theme is to create
layouts that load faster and more versatile than the Big Breeze theme.  The following updates have been made:
1) A new kind of a wide page was created.  The page moves closer to the top.
2) All of the pages now have width limitations for the page body.  This will make it easier for users to
put smaller file size limitations on their media.
3) Extra local fonts have been removed to improve page loading speed.
